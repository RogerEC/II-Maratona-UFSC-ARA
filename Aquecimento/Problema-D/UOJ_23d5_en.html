		<div class="problem">

			<div class="description">
				<p>It is not just Tobias who has a birthday these days. Mine also occurs at that time and every year I always have the same question, what is my age?</p>

<p>I entered college just before the age that people normally enter and it is common for people to be a little scared when I say how old I am. They always think I was older. This only increases my age crisis and my doubts about my current age.</p>

<p>I imagine that I am not the only person who takes some time thinking about the answer to the question “how old are you?”, So to help me and these people who also suffer from this age doubt, I ask that you write a program that gives the person's current day and date of birth tell how old he is.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Input</h2>

			<div class="input">
				<p>The problem entry has 3 lines.</p>

<p>The first line has an <strong>N</strong> string (3&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\leq\) |<strong>N</strong>| <span class="math-tex">\(\leq\)&nbsp;50) with the person's name and is formed only by lowercase or uppercase letters (‘A’ - ‘Z’, ‘a’ - ‘z’) and space characters.</p>

<p>The second line has a string <strong>A</strong> with the current date in the format "DD/MM/YYYY" and the last line contains a string <strong>B</strong> with the date of birth, also in the format "DD/MM/YYYY". The date of birth is guaranteed to occur before the current date.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Output</h2>

			<div class="output">
				<p>Your program should produce a line with the message <strong>"Você tem X anos N."</strong> (without quotes), where <strong>X</strong> is the person's age and <strong>N</strong> is their name. If the current date coincides with the person's birthday, you should print <strong>"Feliz aniversario!"</strong> (without quotes) one line before printing the answer.</p>
